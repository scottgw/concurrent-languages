Program 1: Random matrix generation (randmat)
This program fills a matrix I with pseudo-random integers, given a seed. The output must be independent of the number of threads/cores.

Program 2: Histogram thresholding (thresh)
Given an integer matrix I and a target percentage p, this program constructs a boolean matrix B such that B_ij is set if, and only if, no more than p percent of the values in I are bigger than I_ij.

Program 3: Weighted point selection (winnow)
Each location where a mask B (a boolean matrix) is true becomes a candidate point, with a weight equal to the integer value in an integer matrix I at that location and x and y coordinates equal to its row and column indices. The program sorts these candidate points into increasing order by weight, and selects nelts evenly-spaced points to create the result vector X.

Program 4: Outer product (outer)
This program turns a vector X containing point positions into a dense, symmetric, diagonally dominant matrix A by calculating the distances between each pair of points. The diagonal of the matrix is set to the maximum element in the respective row times the number of elements of the row. It also constructs a real vector V whose values are the distance of each point from the origin.

Program 5: Matrix-vector product (product)
Given a matrix A and a vector V, this program calculates the product A V.

Program 6: Chaining (chain)
This problem chains all of the previous problems together.
